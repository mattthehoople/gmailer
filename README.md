Send emails via gmail.

Author: Matt Tate

edit application/config/mailer.php and add your gmail account username and password, then update the path to the directory to the templates you wish to mail. gmail will require you autherise "unsafe apps" (of which this is one) for the app to work, so please only use on a secondary gmail account you care little about.
